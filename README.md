homingCompass
=============

As part of my MFA Design thesis at California College of the Arts, I made a compass that always points "home." The home point can be set at anytime using a button. The Homing Compass includes some code from Adafruit's Flora NeoGeo Watch as well as some help from Scott Minneman and Adam Coogan.
